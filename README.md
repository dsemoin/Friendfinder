# Friendfinder: https://vast-river-12689.herokuapp.com/
This is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. 
This full-stack site takes in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app then displays the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 
I used Express to handle routing. 
The app is deployed to Heroku.
Use the link above to go to the app and find your match!


I will maintain this app.
